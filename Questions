Which values need to be initialized for new processes in fork1()?

TODO:   checkDeadlock()
        USLOSS_IntVec[USLOSS_CLOCK_INT] = clockHandler (startup())
        

QUESTION:
            Does clock handler push current back to readylist?
            Does readtime need to be written? (phase1.h, not spec)
                    ---->>>> Just write it.

            blockMe functionality. When do we return -1? example.
                    ---->>>> Really no different. Just put a call to isZapped at the end. If yes, return -1.
                    ---->>>> Will call dispatcher within this function.

            Any other error codes need matching?
                    ---->>>> No. All the error cases in provided testcases should match. Don't worry about others'
