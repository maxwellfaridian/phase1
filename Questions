Which values need to be initialized for new processes in fork1()?

QUESTION:
                How do we do the bitwise operation for disable interrupts? psr ^ 0x2  ? (I think this one is done)

               1) What are the parameters for USLOSS_DeviceInput all about?           (Dispatcher, timeSliceChecker (writeMe))
               2) OK. How to properly initialize the USLOSS_IntVec[USLOSS_CLOCK_INT]? Must be related to DeviceInput. (Startup)
               3) When a child quits, if the parent has been QUIT_BLOCKED (waiting for a child to quit),
                        should its parent be put back on the ready list?            (Quit)
